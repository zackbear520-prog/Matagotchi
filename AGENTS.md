# Codex Instructions

- This is a Flipper Zero external app (FAP) built with `ufbt`.
- Always run `ufbt` after edits and keep the build green.
- Prefer small commits; explain what changed and why.
- Do **not** require device connection; use a build-first workflow.
- Follow existing patterns for events, scenes, and threads.
